00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so we're going to take a look at a very simple example

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of using Node's built-in modules and including those via require.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, here at the top of our script you'll see the require function,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
require and then here we're just requiring the os module.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, to get access to the os module we didn't have to do anything special

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in our Node installation, it just comes with Node, but it's not included in your project

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
by default so we have to include it by calling require os

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and we're assigning that to the os variable.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is a module that will give you some information

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
about the operating system that your script is running on.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In this case we're going to print out the host name, we're going to print

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
out the 15 minute load average, which is the third element in the array,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and we're going to print out the free memory and the total memory.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And I have this little function here just to convert what it gives me back to Megabytes.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, it's really as simple as that for the os module.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Obviously as we go through the remaining course modules we're going

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to be diving into more of Node's modules.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The os is one of the more simple ones, but it gives you an idea of the require.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So now let's run this and take a look at the console.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So you'll see the host name, the load average and then the memory statistics here.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, the os module is a handy way to get access to this information in your Node application,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but more importantly this is a very simple example of how you would require

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in an external module using require, assign it to a variable and then use it in your script.
