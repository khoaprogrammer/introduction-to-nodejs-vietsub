00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Publishing your own modules to the NPM registry is very easy

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and is a great way to share your work with others.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's as simple as adding one extra file to your Node project and a couple of extra NPM commands.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The file you need to add to your project root is package.json.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This file describes your modules to NPM and specifies how they should be installed

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
when downloaded from the registry.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It only has a couple of required fields; name and version.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
NPM encourages the use of semantic versioning in your version numbers.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There are another set of optional fields that are primarily used

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
to describe your module on the NPM website.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
These will help others find your module as well as your source code repository.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If your module has any dependencies, you should specify those here as well.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You'll notice that exact version numbers are not required, ranges are also supported.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When NPM installs your module it will also download and install its required dependencies.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Main is where you define the entry point into your module.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is what is executed when someone requires your module.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Once you have this file ready you'll need to run NPM add user

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to create an account on the NPM registry.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
With that in place you simply run NPM publish dot

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
from your project's root directory to publish the module to NPM.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
One additional step I recommend is to move to an empty directory, run NPM install on your module

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and try to use it in a sample Node application.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I know from experience that it is easy to upload a broken module and not realize it because all

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
of the unit tests passed in the working directory before you publish it.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, to conclude; in this module we discussed how to include Node modules

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
in your project using the require statement.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The three common sources of Node modules; the built-in modules,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
your own applications JavaScript files and the NPM registry.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And we wrapped up with the brief discussion on how to define

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and publish your own module to the NPM registry.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I hope this module has been a useful introduction

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to the Node's modules, the require statement and NPM.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Thank you.
