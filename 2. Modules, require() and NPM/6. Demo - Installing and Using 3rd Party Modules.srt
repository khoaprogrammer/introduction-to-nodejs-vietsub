1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So now we're going to take a look at using the Node Package Manager or NPM registry to search

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
for and install third party modules for use within our Node applications.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So a great place to look for modules that might be of interest to you is the NPMJS.org website

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
where you can see statistics about the module ecosystem in general and also some stats

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
about some particular modules, the most depended upon modules

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which arguably would be the most popular modules.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They're the ones that other modules depend on the most and ones

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that are most recently updated etcetera.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now the module that we're interested in this time is the request module,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which is the second most depended upon module.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And when looking at any particular module you'll be able to go to a webpage,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
see some download statistics and just some general information

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
about the module including their read me file.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And so we've decided we would like to install the request module,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is a simplified http request client.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So let's go back to our project and here now we have a very simple script which uses require

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
to load the request module and assign it to the variable request.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We won't go into a whole lot of detail about what it does.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I do suggest you look into it further; it really is a great module.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's also very simple to use and simple to explain.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, if you invoke the request function and the first parameter you pass in the URL

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
that you would like to receive, then the second parameter is a callback.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The callback takes three parameters; of course it follows the Node convention

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
of taking the error parameter as the first parameter to the callback

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and then it has two other parameters in the callback; the response object and the body,

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
which is the text of the response.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So now if we were to run it right now we would get an error

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
because we haven't actually downloaded

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and installed the request module from the NPM registry.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, we need to get it and download and install it locally and the way that we'll do that is

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
with the NPM command from the command line.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
First we need to be sure that we're in the right directory

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
where the script file is that we want to run.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And so, we need to go down into (typing) - and so now we can run the NPM install command

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and we want to install request (silence).

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, and so now that the module's been installed we should be good to go and we can try

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
to run our script and see what we get (silence).

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And so what we have is the html and JavaScript that is the Pluralsight homepage,

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
but we did that by using the request function which came as a part of the request module.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:59:00,000
This was a third party module that we downloaded from the NPM registry.
