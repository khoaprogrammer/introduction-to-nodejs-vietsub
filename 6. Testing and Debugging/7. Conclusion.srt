There are other ways to debug Node applications in cases where you are not using the Cloud9 IDE.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There is a Node inspector module, which provides browser based debugging

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of Node.js debugging applications.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I touch on this option in another Pluralsight course, Node on Windows in Azure.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So to conclude, in this module, we started with an overview of Node's built

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in "assert" module used for writing unit tests of Node.js code.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We then moved on to a more useful and feature rich method

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of writing tests using Mocha and should.js.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We then wrapped up by debugging our Node applications using the features found

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in the Cloud9 IDE.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I hope this module has been helpful in introducing you to the testing

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and debugging features of Node.js.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you.
