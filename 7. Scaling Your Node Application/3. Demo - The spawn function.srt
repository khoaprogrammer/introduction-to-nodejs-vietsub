1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For our next child process example, we'll take a look at the spawn function.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now the spawn function gives you more control over the standard in, standard out,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and standard error of your process while it's running.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you remember in our exec example, we had access to standard out

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and standard error once the process was complete.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In this case, you can actually feed data to standard in and get data from standard

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
out while the process is running.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So in this example, we're spawning two processes, one is the Unix PS command

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to get a list of processes and another command is the grep command

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and we want to look for the phrase Node.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now because the child processes have standard out, standard error and standard in as streams,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we can actually pipe from one to the other.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And so what we've done here is said I'm going to take the standard out of the PS command

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and pipe it to standard in of grep.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In essence, doing a Node what you would otherwise maybe do from the Unix command line

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and then saying, I'm going to take the standard out of grep and send it to the console.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But of course even though we are piping up here, you can also watch

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
for events on the streams as well.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So here, we're looking for a data event on standard error to see if there's an error

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
with the PS command and if there is, we will log that to the console, and the same for grep here.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So let's run this.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So here you can see the command has run and what was printed to the console was the output

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
of the PS command piped through grep.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here you can see node and node so these are commands that passed

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
through grep because they contain node.
