00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So in conclusion, in this module, we learned about creating child processes in Node

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
with the spawn, exec, execFile and fork functions of the child process module.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We then looked at scaling your application using Nodes experimental cluster module.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I hope this has been a helpful introduction to scaling your Node applications.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Thank you.
