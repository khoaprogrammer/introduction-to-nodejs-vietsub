00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We first saw the os module back during our discussion of using require

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to include built-in modules in our Node applications.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The os module provides several functions for examining the operating system

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
on which your Node application is running.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
These include the default temp directory, the host name, the type of os, the platform,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
architecture and release information.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They also include the uptime of the system, the load average, total and free memory,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the number of CPU's, as well as a list of networking interfaces.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Finally, the EOL variable contains the appropriate end

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of line marker for the operating system.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, to conclude; in this module we've looked at several ways Node allows you to interact

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
with your local environment including Node's "process" object,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the fs module for the file system,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
a short diversion to discuss buffers and a recap of the os module.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I hope this has been a helpful look into the local system features provided by Node.js.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Thank you.
