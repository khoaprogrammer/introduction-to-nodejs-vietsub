00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Interacting with the file system in Node is done via the built in fs module.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Many of the functions provided by this module are wrappers around the POSIX functions.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They come in both asynchronous and synchronous flavors.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is the one area of the Node standard library

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
where you will see a significant collection of synchronous functions.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The fs module also provides a couple of stream oriented functions;

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
create ReadSream opens a file for reading and returns a readable stream,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
create WriteStream opens a file for writing and returns a writable stream.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
These are useful for integrating with other streams as we did in our last module.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Lastly, the fs module provides a watch function

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which will watch a file or directory for changes.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The function returns and event emitter which emits a change event whenever a file changes.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's take a look at interacting with a file system using the fs module (silence).
