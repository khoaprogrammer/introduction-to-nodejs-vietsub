To build a web application of any significance in Node.js, you'll likely want

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to leverage a web framework that runs on top of Node.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
One very popular framework is ExpressJS.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I encourage you to check out the Pluralsight course on ExpressJS if you want

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to learn more about building web apps in Node.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So in this module, we've covered using HTTP requests as a web client,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
using HTTP create server to build a web server, and extending that model

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to include Socket.IO for real-time communication.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I hope this module has been helpful in introducing you to the benefits

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of using Node to interact with the web.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Thank you.
