1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this second example, we're going to take a look at the second pattern we discussed earlier

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
where we have an object that extends the EventEmitter class.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what we've done is we've taken our original example and basically cut it in half,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and we've taken the code that emits the events and separated it

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
out into a separate JavaScript file.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So let's start by taking a look at that file.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So here you'll see we have a function called Resource which takes a number,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and I've hidden the contents of the function for now.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll get to that in just a minute.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But what this function basically does --

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
this is ourObject, and ourObject extends or inherits from EventEmitter.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So in order to do that, we're using Node's util module which we've required here.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's a built-in module and it has an Inherits function.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And what we've said is, we want our resource object to inherit from the EventEmitter object,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which gives us access to the On function and the Emit function, and also, because we want scripts

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that included this file as a module, to have access to our resource object.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We set module.exports equal to resource.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now if we look down inside the code for the Resource function,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you'll see that it's almost identical to what we saw in our getResource function.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
process.netTick is here.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Events are emitted here.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The only difference is that because in our previous example,

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we were instantiating an EventEmitter and using that instantiated variable

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to call the Emit function, in this case

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
because our Resource function inherits from EventEmitter.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It is our Resource function that's doing the emitting of the events and so we need to use the

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
"This" variable to access the current resource that needs to do the emitting.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is all packaged up in a Resource.js.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So now let's take a look at the JavaScript code that is using this.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In our main script file we have a Require statement and here,

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
because we're requiring another JavaScript file in our project, we have the dot slash

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and then the name of the file which is Resource.js,

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and we're storing it in a Resource variable.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So in this example, instead of simply calling a function and getting an instance

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
of an EventEmitter back, we're instantiating our Resource object and getting

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
that back here and the variable Are.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But once we do that, we're subscribing to the same events we did before.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So let's run this and see if we get what we expect.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
( Typing Sounds)

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And, yes, as you would expect, we're getting the -- I've started, the Start event,

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and then seven data events because we passed in a seven, and then the End event.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So the net effect, at least in the console, is the same.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But these are the two types of patterns that you'll see from time to time.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You may have an actual object that you instantiate that emits Events,

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:59:00,000
or you may have a case where you call a function and get an EventEmitter back.
