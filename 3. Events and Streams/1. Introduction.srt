2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Paul O'Fallon, and I'd like to welcome you to the course,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
An Introduction to Node.js, Module 3, Events and Streams.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In this module we'll discuss the differences between callbacks and events.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We'll look at Node's EventEmmiter class as well as a couple

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
of patterns for using Event Emitters.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll then move on to Readable and WriteableStreams and piping between streams.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So let's get started.
