1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, in conclusion, in this module we examined the differences between callbacks and events

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
for implementing non-blocking asynchronous code.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We then looked at the EventEmitter class and two common patterns for using it.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
From there, we moved on to Readable and WriteableStreams including,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
piping data from one to the other.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I hope this module has been helpful in introducing you to the concepts

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of EventEmitters and streams and their js.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thank you.
