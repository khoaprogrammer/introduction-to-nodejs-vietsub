00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
"Node.js" is a server-side "JavaScript" platform.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It was first introduced to the community by its creator, Ryan Dahl,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
at the "2009 JSConf.eu Conference".

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Its presentation was received with a standing ovation.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Since that time, "Node" has continued to evolve, with contributions from the community as well

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
as the project's primary sponsor, cloud computing Company Joyent.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
"Node" is among the most popular projects on "GitHub", often beating out other heavyweights

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
such as "jQuery" and "Ruby on Rails".

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
At a high level, "Node" is comprised of three building blocks.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The first is "Lib UV", a high performance, cross-platform evented IO library.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's a fairly new addition to "Node", and replaces

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or abstracts several UNIX-only libraries once directly required by the project.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
"Lib UV" was built as a part of porting "Node.js" to the "Windows" environment.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Next is "V8".

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is Google's "JavaScript" engine, the same engine found in their Chrome web browser.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The "Node" team makes every effort to leverage "V8" out of the box within "Node".

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This makes it easier for the team to include updated versions of "V8" in each release

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
of "Node", and thereby benefit from Google's continuous innovation

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
of their "JavaScript" engine.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The last component of "Node" is the custom "C++"

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and "JavaScript" code developed specifically for the "Node" platform itself.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
These three things together make up the "Node.js" platform.
