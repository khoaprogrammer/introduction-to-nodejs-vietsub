1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You can, of course, edit "JavaScript" files for "Node" in your favorite text editor

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and run them from the command line.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
However, many of the examples in this course will be shown using the free version

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
of the web-based "Cloud9 IDE".

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It provides browser support for many of the common editing, running,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and debugging tasks you'll do as a part of "Node" development.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In fact, much of "Cloud9" itself was written in "Node.js".

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In this screenshot, you can see some of the syntax highlighting,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and even code completion support, for "Node.js" applications.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's take a quick look,, and familiarize ourselves with some

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
of the features provided by "Cloud9".

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So to get started with "Cloud9", you'll want to go to the home page, which is at c9.IO.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now once you're here, you can sign up by creating an account directly on "Cloud9",

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or log in with your "GitHub" or "Bitbucket" account.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now I chose to associate my login on "Cloud9" with my "GitHub" account, and,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
since I've been here before, it already knows who I am and it's asking me to go

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
to "My Dashboard", so let's click here and do that.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So here you can see "My Dashboard".

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What it has down the left is the projects that I'm currently editing,

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
or currently have active on "Cloud9".

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But because I've associated with my "GitHub" account,

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
it also has all of my projects that are on "GitHub".

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But what we want to do here is we're going to go into the project that I've created that has all

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
of the simple code for this course, and that's this "PS Intro to Node", so let's click on that.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And we'll want to start editing.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So once we get into a particular workspace, it should look familiar to you

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
if you've used any other "IDE" before.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It shares a lot in common with, say, "Visual Studio" or "Eclipse".

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's got a series of menus across the top that you can use to do various functions within the

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"IDE", but one in particular that's unique to "Cloud9" is this "Share" function.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can invite someone by email, "Twitter", or "Facebook" to come

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and co-develop a project with you.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And I've used this once before and it's really,

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
really impressive to see somebody else editing your file, and running it,

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and watching the output in the console from someone else running it.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's pretty impressive.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now over here on the side you'll see the tree structure

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
for our project, and the folders and files.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But you can do several other things with this sidebar if that's not what you want to see.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can only show the open files, or you can set your "Run" in "Debug Options".

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And here is where if you wanted to run it in a different version of "Node", you could do that.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So here they have "Node" 8.X and 6.X. or if this was a "PHP" project,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
you could set that there as well.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now if you'll remember, on our "Linux" instance, where we were using "NVM" to switch

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
between version 8 and version 6 of "Node", and you had to download and compile version 6,

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you don't have to do any of that here.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You can just pick the one that you want to use, and it's there for you.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And then, when you're ready to deploy, you can deploy to a couple

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
of different providers directly from "Cloud9".

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So you can deploy to "Heroku" or "Windows Azure" directly from the "IDE".

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And then, of course, there's a lot of settings that you can set about the

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
"IDE" to tailor it to your liking.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So then here is a tabbed-based editing window

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
which you would be familiar with from other "IDEs".

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now it's one other thing that's kind of interesting is that, in particular for "Node",

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
is that the "Cloud9 IDE" has pretty good support for code completion and syntax highlighting

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
for "Node" -- well, syntax highlighting for "JavaScript" and code completion for "Node" --

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
so, for instance, if I go and type "Console.log",

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
you'll see how it's giving me assistance there.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
In fact, if I just do "Consoles" and then stop, I can scroll through the various functions

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that it has, and, you know, get some extra information about those,

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and some documentation here as well, and actually some assistance.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If I've left a syntax error here, I can get some guidance as well.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And then, down here at the bottom has a console and then an output window,

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
so in the console you can enter a lot of different commands, some of which are kind

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
of "UNIX" style commands, and some are special to this console.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So if we type in "Help", we can see the commands that are here, and some of them about navigating

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
to tabs are specific to "Cloud9", but then also, if you scroll up further,

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you'll see things like "LS" and "MV", so more "UNIX" style commands.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So if you're more comfortable with typing things,

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and want to do less mouse movement, you can do that.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It also supports a lot of keyboard shortcuts, so "Control-S" to save a file and what not.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If you run an application -- so let's run this one, just super simple, we'll save it first;

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
now we'll run it -- and you can see that now we're in the

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
"Output" tab here, and we're seeing "Hello, world."

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now a couple of these -- a couple lines will show

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
up whenever you run a "Node" code on "Cloud9".

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In this case, we're just printing to the console so they don't apply, but they're here anyway,

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
so it's reminding us that we should use "Process EMV Port" and "IP"

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
as the host import of our scripts.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And then if I wanted to see the web App that I was writing

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
in "Cloud9", I could click on this link.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So now let's run just a barely, slightly more complicated example.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's do that "Set Time-out" that we did on the "Linux" VM.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
( Typing on Keyboard )

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And we'll run that, and there you go.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You see "Hello, world" in the output.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Now let's go back to the "Node" home page and grab that code

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and try creating a simple HTTP server.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So here we are again on the "Node" home page.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's scroll down and grab this code again, and we will paste it here.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Now the reminder it gave us down here matters, so let's go ahead and, since we're not going

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to be necessarily running it at that host and IP, let's take that out.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And let's grab these descriptors they suggested that we use

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
for these variables for the port and the IP.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll paste those in, and now we'll run this.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And you can see it actually pulled it up in a browser here.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If we want to pull it up in a separate tab, or separate window, we can just click on this...

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
( Background Sounds )

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
...and there you go, "Hello, World."

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now the host name of the instance is "Cloud9" or "C9.io", then my username,

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and then the name of the workspace.

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And it's "Hello, world", and that is what's running here, and so it's a very simple way

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to come in, sign up, to get yourself a development environment and a web server.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Most of the examples that we do in this course, we're going to do in "Cloud9".

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It would be great for you to go ahead and sign up for a free account and keep up.
