00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There are several ways to get "Node.js".

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There are installers and binaries available for download at nodejs.org,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and "Node" is available via many common "Linux" package managers.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Of course, the source code is also available if you'd like to download and build it yourself.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
One handy way I've found to manage my "Node" installations in a "Linux"

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or "Mac" environment is with "NVM",

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
a tool developed by Tim Caswell in the spirit of Ruby's "RVM".

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It can be cloned directly from "GitHub", and used to install

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and manage any number of "Node" versions.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Because "Node" is evolving so rapidly, tools like "NVM" can be helpful not only

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
with the manual task of downloading and building a new release, but also by allowing you

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
to rapidly switch executables for testing your code

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
against multiple versions of "Node" all on one system.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Here you see the steps to get started.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
After cloning, simply source the shell script and run "NVM Install" with a version number.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can switch versions with the "NVM Use" statement, and you can set your default version

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of "Node" with the "NVM Alias Default" statement.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's take a look at using "NVM" to install "Node".
